Searching for house is bit difficult and it took lots of time. Instead of searching house directly. Here we have House Rent Management System.
Here we have two roles customer and seller.
The customer can view a list of houses and book house for rent .The customer also have
rights to cancel their bookings . The seller can add the houses and can accept or decline the
customer request .
